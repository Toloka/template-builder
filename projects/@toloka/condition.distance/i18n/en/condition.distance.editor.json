    "description": "This component checks whether the sent coordinates match the ones that you specified. \n\nFor example, you want a Toloker to take a photo of a specific place. The `condition.distance` component checks whether the photo was taken at the location that you specified.\n\nThe device coordinates are sent using the [data.location](data.location.md) component. You can use it without `condition.distance` if you need to read a Toloker's device coordinates without comparing them to the specified ones.\n\n[View example in the sandbox](https://ya.cc/t/HFMC2_XU3y3Tps)",
