    "description": "The If...Then...Else operator. Allows you to execute either one block of code or another, depending on the condition. If you need more options, use [helper.switch](helper.switch.md).\n\nFor example, if you want to conduct a survey, you can use the `helper.if` component to ask the gender of the respondent and add different sets of questions, depending on whether the respondent is male or female.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nIf the condition in `if` is true (returns `true`), the code specified in the `then` property will be executed. Otherwise (the condition is false and returns `false`) the code specified in `else` will be executed.\n\nThe `else` property is optional. For example, you ask a Toloker \"do you like the image?\". You can make a comment field appear when a negative response is selected. And if a positive response is selected then nothing happens.\n\nTo learn more about conditions, see the [List of conditions](conditions.md).\n\n[View example](https://ya.cc/t/J3dYyctN3xPHGy)\n\n**Components used in the example**\n\n- [view.list](view.list.md): Displays data in a list.\n- [view.text](view.text.md): Displays a text.\n- [view.image](view.image.md): Displays an image.\n- [field.radio-group](field.radio-group.md): Adds a component for selecting one value out of several options.\n- [condition.equals](condition.equals.md): Checks whether the original value is equal to the specified value.\n- [field.text](field.text.md): A field for entering a short text, not more than a line.",
