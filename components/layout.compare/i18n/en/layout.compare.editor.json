You can also add common elements, such as a field for comments.\n\n[View example in the sandbox](https://ya.cc/t/MwYMw5-q3x7Lrs)\n\nDifferences from [layout.side-by-side](layout.side-by-side.md):\n* No buttons for hiding items. These are useful if you need to compare 5 photos at once and it's difficult to choose between two of them.\n* You can add individual selection buttons for every item being compared.",
