Straight quotation marks (`\"`) must be escaped like this: `\\\"`.\n\nExamples of Markdown syntax:\n```\n# Level 1 header\n## Level 2 header (and so on to level 6)\n\n**Bold**\n\n* Italics*\n\n~~Crossed out text~~\n\n+ Bulleted list\n  + List sublevels are separated by two additional spaces\n- The list can start with any of these characters: + - *\n\n1.

Do not use this component to display plain text. If you need to display text without formatting, use the [view.text](view.text.md) component. If you need to insert a link, use [view.link](view.link.md), and for an image use [view.image](view.image.md).\n\nLinks with Markdown are appended with `target=\"_blank\"` (the link opens in a new tab), as well as `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`.",
